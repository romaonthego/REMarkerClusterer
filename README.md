# REMarkerClusterer
###REMarkerClusterer creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.

As seen in [Pinsnap](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinsnap/id457407067?mt=8) iPhone app. `REMarkerClusterer` was inspired by the Apple Photos app on the iPhone, `REMarkerClusterer` mimics it's behaviour providing animations for grouping and ungrouping clusters.

## How it works
The `REMarkerClusterer` will group markers into clusters according to their distance from a cluster's center. When a marker is added, the marker cluster will find a position in all the clusters, and if it fails to find one, it will create a new cluster with the marker. The number of markers in a cluster will be displayed on the cluster marker. When the map viewport changes, `REMarkerClusterer` will destroy the clusters in the viewport and regroup them into new clusters.

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.6 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC (if you want to use in a project without ARC just add the flag `-fobjc-arc` to the files in the Build Phases tab of your project)

## Demo

Build and run the `REMarkerClustererExample` project in Xcode to see `REMarkerClusterer` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REMarkerClusterer` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REMarkerClusterer:

``` bash
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'REMarkerClusterer', '~> 2.1.3'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

`REMarkerClusterer` requires the `MapKit` and `CoreLocation` frameworks, so the first thing you'll need to do is include the frameworks into your project.

Now that the framework has been linked, all you need to do is drop files from `REMarkerClusterer` folder into your project, and add `#include "REMarkerClusterer.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
// Add map view
//
_mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)];
_mapView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
[self.view addSubview:_mapView];

// Create clusterer, assign a map view and delegate (MKMapViewDelegate)
//
_clusterer = [[REMarkerClusterer alloc] initWithMapView:_mapView delegate:self];

// Set smaller grid size for an iPad
//
_clusterer.gridSize = UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone ? 25 : 20;
_clusterer.clusterTitle = @"%i items";

// Populate with sample data
//
NSDictionary *data = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Points" ofType:@"plist"]];
NSInteger index = 0;
for (NSDictionary *dict in [data objectForKey:@"Points"]) {
    REMarker *marker = [[REMarker alloc] init];
    marker.markerId = [[dict objectForKey:@"id"] intValue];
    marker.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake([[dict objectForKey:@"latitude"] floatValue], [[dict objectForKey:@"longitude"] floatValue]);
    marker.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"One item <id: %i>", index];
    marker.userInfo = @{@"index": @(index)};
    [_clusterer addMarker:marker];
    index++;
}

// Create clusters
//
[_clusterer clusterize];

// Zoom to show all clusters/markers on the map
//
[_clusterer zoomToAnnotationsBounds:_clusterer.markers];
```
